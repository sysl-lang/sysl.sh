/** Runs the programs printed on the documentation site, which are source on disk like `guide/` is —
 * except that here the file the reader sees and the file the compiler is handed are the *same
 * bytes*.
 *
 * A tutorial's examples rot silently. Nothing in an ordinary build reads them, so a page goes on
 * claiming what the language did a year ago and the first person to find out is a reader who typed
 * it in and got a diagnostic. That failure is worse than no page at all: it costs the reader their
 * confidence that anything else on the site is true either.
 *
 * So a fenced block is not a picture of a program, it *is* the program. Which one it is comes from
 * what follows it, which is also how it reads to somebody scrolling past:
 *
 *   - a `sysl` block followed by an `output` block is a whole program, and the output block is what
 *     it prints — compiled, run, and compared;
 *   - a `sysl` block followed by an `error` block is a program the compiler **refuses**, and the
 *     error block is what it says — compiled, required to fail, and the diagnostic required to
 *     contain that text;
 *   - a `sysl` block with neither under it is a fragment, quoted for its shape, and is not run.
 *
 * The refusals matter as much as the acceptances. A language is defined as much by what it will not
 * let you write, and a page that shows only working code teaches half of it — so the surface that
 * checks a refusal is here from the start rather than bolted on once somebody wants it.
