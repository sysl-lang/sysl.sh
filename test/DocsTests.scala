 * Two things are asserted, and the second is what makes the first mean anything. Every program on a
 * page does what the page says it does — and the **number** of programs on each page is the number
 * written down here. A fence that stopped being recognised, a page that lost its `output` block in
 * an edit, a chapter quietly reduced to prose: each of those turns a checked program into an
 * unchecked one, and without the count they all look exactly like a page whose programs pass.
 *
 * That is the same reason `GuideTests` counts the `ok` lines rather than only looking for `FAIL`,
 * and it was learned there the hard way.

   * program a whole compile, link and run: a clang invocation, a linker invocation and a process,
   * for a program of six lines. There are close to four hundred of those across the site, and as one
   * test they were four hundred of them in a row on one std while the rest of the machine idled.
   * They are completely independent — separate temporary files, separate processes, nothing shared —
   * so the only thing that made them sequential was being written inside a single `in`.
   *
   * **The unit is a program and not a page, because a page is not small enough.** Splitting by page
   * first was the obvious step and it stalled at sixty seconds, all but one of which was
   * `reference/errors.md` — forty-seven programs on one page, nineteen of them a full build, taking
   * forty-nine seconds on whichever single thread drew it while the rest of the machine finished
   * and waited. A run is only as short as its longest test, so the longest test has to be one
   * program. The `error` blocks come along at no cost either way: a refusal never reaches the
   * toolchain at all (`check`).
   *
   * A failure still names the page, because that is what a reader goes and fixes; the ordinal beside
   * it is the same one the census counts in, so it says which block without anyone counting fences.
