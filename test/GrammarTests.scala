/** The site's syntax-highlighting grammar, checked against the lexer it is supposed to describe.
 *
 * `docs/grammars/sysl.tmLanguage.json` is a second, hand-written statement of which words are
 * keywords, and nothing makes the two agree. A word added to `SyslLexical.reserved` is a keyword the
 * compiler honours and the site renders as an ordinary identifier — which looks like a line that
 * simply has little to highlight rather than like a fault, so it survives being looked at. `ref` did
 * exactly that: reserved, taught in the tour, and unstyled on the published page.
 *
 * Both directions are checked against the grammar's **`keyword` section only**. The predeclared
 * scalars are styled from a section of their own and are deliberately *not* reserved words — that is
 * what lets the open `iN` / `uN` families need no lexical support — so a check spanning the whole
 * file would have to allow them and would stop meaning anything.
