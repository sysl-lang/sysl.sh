summary: A transform kept beside the definition it rearranges, and checked against it.
weight: 50
---

The discrete Fourier transform, twice: the O(n log n) one everybody uses and the O(n²) one that is
the definition.

**Having both is the point.** The fast transform is a *rearrangement* of the slow one, and a
rearrangement is exactly the kind of thing that can be subtly wrong and still produce plausible
numbers — so the slow one is kept as the thing to compare against. Published values then anchor the
pair, since two implementations by the same author agreeing proves only that they agree.

**The axis: an algorithm checked against its own definition.** Every other program in the set is
checked against values somebody else wrote down, and this one is too — but it also carries the thing
it is supposed to be equal to, and runs it. A spot check accepts a plausible number; the definition
does not.

**The complex arithmetic used to be this program's own, and is now
[`sysl.math.complex`](/library/complex/).** That is the ordinary end of a guide program's life: it
was written here because there was nothing to import, the friction it turned up is what moved the
language, and once the type existed there was no reason for a second copy of it. Nothing in the
language knows what a complex number is — the [operator traits](/reference/expressions/) are still
the whole mechanism, and the program still leans on them hardest.

## What it found

**The width of an integer type is askable, and the first draft said it was not.** This is a finding
that got *retracted*, which is worth as much as one that stands. The header originally recorded that
the machine word width could not be obtained at a type parameter; it can —
`count_ones() + count_zeros()` is the width by construction, at whatever `Self` turned out to be. That
is what [`sysl.math`](/library/math/) means by keeping the second of that pair rather than leaving it
to a subtraction, and it means nothing has to hard-code 64.

**What actually stops the closed form is the empty shift.** `Bits.reverse_bits` reverses the whole
width, so bit-reversing an index would be `v.reverse_bits() >> (w - bits)` — and a one-sample
transform reaches that with `bits` at zero, since `bit_width(1)` is `trailing_zeros(1)`, which is
zero. A shift by the full width is the case the instruction does not define, so the loop stays.

That is the more useful shape of finding: not "the language cannot express this" but "the language
expresses it and the *machine* has an edge case", which no amount of language design removes.

**A trait written for somebody else's type has to find a name that is still free.** What survived the
move to the library is `sum` — the generic total that starts at a value the type promised rather than
at `xs[0]`, which is what keeps an empty sequence from needing an `Option` in the signature. The
trait behind it wanted a `zero() -> Self` and could not have one: a trait's members become the
implementing type's, and `zero` on `Complex` is already taken — by [`Zero`](/library/math/), the core
trait that answers this exact need. So the member is called `identity`, for what it is rather than for
the value it answers. The more ordinary the concept, the likelier that collision is, and there is no
way to name the member the trait *means* apart from the name it goes under.

**Which raises the obvious question: why not just use `Zero`?** For a sum over the floats or over
`Complex`, you should — `[T: Add + Zero]` is the ordinary spelling and needs no trait of your own.
What keeps this program's four lines is the one type `Zero` cannot reach: `int`. The `iN` / `uN`
families are open, so no finite list of `impl` blocks covers them, and every membership the compiler
hands out is a method with a **receiver**, which a `zero()` has no value to be called on. A body that
must serve a built-in integer *and* a library type still declares its own identity, and that is the
only shape left that does.
