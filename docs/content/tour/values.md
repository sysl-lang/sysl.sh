title: Values and bindings
summary: Three ways to name a value, a scalar family with no surprises in it, and why nothing widens on its own.

## Naming a value

Three keywords, differing in what may happen to the thing afterwards:

```sysl
var count = 3            // storage that may change
val limit: int = 10      // storage that may not
const step: int = 2      // not storage at all — a value known while compiling

count = count + step
print("count:", count, "of", limit)
```

```output
count: 5 of 10
```

`var` and `val` are the pair most languages have. `const` is the different one: it is not a variable
that happens to be fixed, it is a value the compiler substitutes wherever the name appears, so there
is nothing at run time to read. That is why it insists on its type being written and on having a
value — a `const` with either missing is refused rather than inferred, because a name with no
storage and no value is nothing at all.

`limit` writes its type for a reason worth knowing early, because it is the first place the file's
top level behaves differently from the inside of a function. These statements are at **module
level**, and a module-level `val` is part of the module's surface — something another file can see —
so its type is stated rather than inferred from whatever happens to be on the right today. The same
`val limit = 10` inside a function infers happily, because a local is nobody else's business.

A module-level `val` **may** hold a value the program had to build — a reference, a slice, a string
put together while running. Storage that exists for the whole run is never let go of, so the count it
takes is never given back, which is what a static is. What the value is decides only *when* the
storage gets filled: numbers, characters, booleans, string literals and tables of them are complete
before the program starts, and anything else is built by a prologue that runs before the first
statement.

`print` takes any number of arguments, renders each one, and puts a space between them. It comes from
`sysl`, the standard module — the one module a file may name without importing it.

## The scalar types

Integers are an open family: `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64` and the unsigned `u8` … `u64`, with `isize`
and `usize` for the pointer-width pair. The common ones also have friendly names, and those are what
ordinary code uses:

| friendly | is |
|---|---|
| `int` | `i32` |
| `byte` | `u8` |
| `short`, `long` | `i16`, `i64` |
| `uint`, `ushort`, `ulong` | `u32`, `u16`, `u64` |
| `real` | `f64` |

Floats are a closed set — `f32` and `f64` — because IEEE 754 defines those and not an open family.
`real` is `f64`, and it is the width arithmetic reaches for unless a program says otherwise.

Then `bool`, `char`, and `string`.

## Every width is its own type

This is the part that catches people arriving from C. A width is a *type*, not a hint, and no value
changes width on its own:

```sysl
var small: byte = 200
var wide: u64 = 18446744073709551615

print("byte:", small + 100, small >> 3)
print("u64 max:", wide)
```

```output
byte: 44 25
u64 max: 18446744073709551615
```

`small + 100` is `byte` arithmetic, so it wraps at 256 and gives 44. It does not quietly become an
`int` because the answer would not fit — the type said `byte`, and `byte` is what the arithmetic
is. An unsuffixed literal like `100` takes the type of what is around it, which is what lets that
line be written without a suffix on every number.

### The family is open, and that is not a figure of speech

`i8` through `i64` are the widths with familiar names, not the widths that exist. `iN` and `uN` are an
**open family parameterized by a bit width**, so `u12`, `i5` and `u256` are types you may write, and
each is its own type with its own arithmetic — a `u12` wraps at 4096 because that is what twelve bits
hold:

```sysl
struct Pixel
    red:   u5
    green: u6
    blue:  u5

var p = Pixel(31u5, 40u6, 17u5)

var counter: u12 = 4000

print("wraps at 4096:", counter + 100u12)
print("and divides:", counter / 7u12)
print("packed:", int(p.red), int(p.green), int(p.blue))
```

```output
wraps at 4096: 4
and divides: 571
packed: 31 40 17
```

That is the reason the rule above is worth stating as "a width is a type" rather than "there are eight
integer types". A 16-bit colour pixel really is a 5-bit field, a 6-bit field and another 5-bit field,
and writing it that way gets the wrapping and the range checking for free instead of hand-masking
them out of a `u16`.

Storage rounds up to whole bytes and an alignment the machine has — a `u12` occupies two bytes — so a
narrow width buys correct arithmetic rather than tight packing. The
[reference](/reference/types/) has the ceiling and the two costs at extreme widths.

Ask for a wider type and the compiler will not do it silently:

```sysl
var small: byte = 200
var wide: int = small
print(wide)
```

```error
cannot initialize 'wide': declared int but the value is byte
```

The fix is to say so, and every conversion is written with call syntax:

```sysl
var small: byte = 200

print("widened:", int(small))
print("truncated:", int(3.9))
print("divided:", f32(7) / f32(2))
print("code point:", u32('A'))
```

```output
widened: 200
truncated: 3
divided: 3.5
code point: 65
```

`int(3.9)` truncates rather than rounds, and `f32(7) / f32(2)` is float division because both
operands are floats — writing `7 / 2` would have been integer division giving 3. Which one you get
follows from the types, and the types are written down.

## Characters are not small integers

A `char` is one Unicode scalar value. It compares and prints, and it does not do arithmetic:

```sysl
var letter = 'é'

print("char:", letter, 'a' <= letter, char(9731))
```

```output
char: é true ☃
```

Ordering is defined, so `'a' <= letter` answers. Adding `1` to it is not, because "the next scalar
value" is rarely what a program that wrote `letter + 1` actually meant. When the code point *is*
what you want, `u32(letter)` says so and `char(9731)` goes back the other way.

## Assignment is an expression

It yields the value assigned, which is what lets a chain work and a condition read normally:

```sysl
var a = 0
var b = 0

a = b = 7
print("both:", a, b)
```

```output
both: 7 7
```

A binding takes a comma list too, so two names can be introduced, or swapped, in one line:

```sysl
demo()
    val lo, hi = 1, 10
    var x, y = 3, 4

    x, y = y, x
    print("range:", lo, hi, "swapped:", x, y)

demo()
```

```output
range: 1 10 swapped: 4 3
```

The right-hand side is evaluated before anything is stored, so `x, y = y, x` is a swap and needs no
temporary.

This one is inside a function rather than at the top level, and it has to be. A binding that names
several things has nowhere to write a type, and a module-level binding is required to have one — so
the comma form is a local's convenience, and the compiler says exactly that if you try it at module
level.

cover `if`, `match` and the loops as well.
