title: Language Reference
summary: The language in full, organized for looking things up rather than for reading through.

The [tour](/tour/) teaches sysl in the order the ideas make sense to learn. This section is the other
shape: every construct written down once, in its own place, with the rules complete rather than the
ones a beginner needs first.

It is meant to answer the question you actually have. What may follow `for`? Which conversions are
implicit? What exactly does `?` do to a `&T` payload? When is a closure boxed? Those are lookups, and
a tutorial answers them only by accident.

**The same guarantee holds here.** Every program on these pages is compiled and run by the test
suite, and every refusal is a refusal the compiler really makes, quoted from its own diagnostic. A
page that drifts from the compiler fails the build. Where a rule has an edge, the edge is shown as a
program rather than described — a sentence about what would happen is a guess, and a fenced block
that runs is not.

**Where a rule exists for a reason, the reason is here too.** A reference that only lists behaviour
tells you what to type and leaves you unable to predict anything you have not looked up yet. sysl's
rules are unusually load-bearing on one another — the memory model decides what a closure costs,
which decides what a trait object can be, which decides what a generic can promise — so the
connections are written down where they matter. Thorough is the point; brevity is not.

## How this section is organized

The order runs from the smallest units upward: what the compiler reads, then what a type is, then
what an expression is, then the declarations that bind them, then the systems built on top —
memory, traits, generics, modules, errors, the foreign interface, and the forms that reach into the
compilation itself.

**One page is about the project rather than the language.** [Packages](/reference/packages/) is
what `package.hocon` says and what it means to depend on somebody else's code — a build-time
concern rather than a rule the compiler enforces on an expression, but one that decides which
modules a program even has.

**What ships beside the language is a section of its own.** The
[standard library](/library/) is ordinary sysl — no type in it is a language feature and a program
could have written any of it — so it is documented apart from the rules the compiler enforces.

**This section is the specification.** It used to share that job with a set of numbered design
chapters in the compiler's repository, which carried each rule's argument and the alternatives that
were rejected; those were removed once this section had overtaken them, because two documents saying
the same thing is one that goes stale. What is here is what the language *is*, and the reason is
given wherever a rule would be unpredictable without it.
