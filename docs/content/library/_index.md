title: Standard Library
summary: What ships with the compiler, module by module — the core every program has, and the layers a target may not.
weight: 40

The [reference](/reference/) is the *language*: what the compiler reads, what a type is, what a
declaration binds. This section is the other half of what a program has — **the modules that ship
with the compiler**, and what each of them offers.

They are kept apart on purpose. Nothing in this section is a language feature: every type here is an
ordinary struct or enum, every function is ordinary sysl, and a program could have written any of it.
`Option` is a generic enum, `unwrap` is a member that calls `exit`, `print` is a library function
reached by a desugaring. The line matters because it is the language's own rule about itself —
**there are no functions built into the compiler that a program could not have written**, and the one
exception is the seam out to C.

So a page in the reference tells you what the compiler will accept. A page here tells you what
somebody already wrote for you, and where it will not be there.

## The library is a tree, and the tree is the point

`sysl` is one module with submodules under it, and each is a directory. A program reaches the core
without asking; everything below it is [imported](/reference/modules/) by name.

| module | holds | requires |
|---|---|---|
| [`sysl`](/library/core/) | the core — `Option`, `Result`, `Display`, the operator traits, `print`, `assert` | — |
| [`sysl.text`](/library/text/) | the whole text surface — validation, the character cursors, `Ascii` and `Search`, splitting and joining, `StrBuilder`, the parsers, `CString` | — |
| [`sysl.regex`](/library/regex/) | POSIX Extended Regular Expressions — `regex`, `Regex`, `Match` | — |
| [`sysl.buf`](/library/buf/) | `Buf[T]`, the growable sequence, and `ByteSink` | — |
| [`sysl.io`](/library/io/) | `Reader`, `stdin()`, `lines()` | — |
| [`sysl.fs`](/library/fs/) | files and paths — `read_text`, `write_bytes`, `exists`, `rename`, and `IoError` | `os` |
| [`sysl.math`](/library/math/) | `max`, `min`, `pi`, the float functions, the integer traits `Signed` and `Bits`, and the integer arithmetic above them — `pow`, `gcd`, `lcm`, `divmod`, `is_power_of_two`, `next_power_of_two` | — |
| [`sysl.math.complex`](/library/complex/) | `Complex[F: Float]` — the operators at two argument lists each, the transcendental set, and the branch cuts | — |
| [`sysl.time`](/library/time/) | `Instant` and `Duration`, the civil calendar — `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime`, `Offset` — the fixed-offset conversions, and the ISO 8601 renderers and parsers | — |
| [`sysl.sync`](/library/sync/) | `Atomic[T]`, `SpinLock`, and the five memory orderings | — |
| [`sysl.thread`](/library/thread/) | `spawn`, `Thread.join`, `yield_now`, and `Mutex[T]` | `threads`, `posix` |
| [`sysl.term`](/library/term/) | the escape sequences a terminal understands — colour, emphasis, and the screen | — |
| [`sysl.term.tty`](/library/term/#whether-to-write-escapes-at-all--sysltermtty) | whether to write them at all — `is_tty`, `color_wanted`, `color`, `color_err` | `posix` |
| [`sysl.args`](/library/args/) | command-line options — `Scan`, `Cli`, and `args_of` for a raw `argv` | — |
| [`sysl.sys`](/library/sys/) | the platform seam — what a freestanding target replaces | — |

**The split is by capability, not by taste.** `sysl.fs` is `requires os`, because a filesystem is
something the environment either has or does not; `sysl.thread` is `requires threads` and `posix`,
because pthreads is what it is built on; `sysl.term.tty` is `requires posix`, because `isatty` is.
Those three are the whole of the column, and a module a target cannot support is therefore not one
that fails to link — it is one a [capability clause](/reference/modules/) will not let that program
import in the first place.

It is also why `sysl.term.tty` is a module of its own rather than a function in `sysl.term`. A
requirement is module-wide, so one function asking for `posix` beside the escape sequences would have
taken all forty constants away from the allocator-free programs that most want to colour a line.

That is why the atomics live apart from the threads: `sysl.sync` requires **nothing**, so a kernel
can have a spinlock without acquiring a scheduler along with it.

**`alloc` is not in that column, and the omission is the point.** No module requires it, because
allocation is refused at the **call** rather than at the import — so a program under `no alloc` still
imports `sysl.text` and still gets `from_utf8`, the cursors, and `Search`, and is refused only where
it reaches for `join` or a `StrBuilder`. A capability that gated whole modules would have cost the
allocator-free subset most of the library it can actually use.

## Where some of this already is

Three pieces of the library are documented in the reference instead, because the language has
machinery that only makes sense beside them:

- **`Option`, `Result` and the `Fallible` latch** are on [errors and
  contracts](/reference/errors/), because `?` is a language form and it is what those types are for.
- **`assert` and `panic`** are on [attributes and compile time](/reference/attributes/), beside the
  `@test` protocol they exist to serve.
- **The operator traits** — which trait a `+` or a `<` reaches — are on
  [expressions](/reference/expressions/), because dispatch is a rule about the operator rather than
  about the trait.

This section links to them rather than repeating them.
