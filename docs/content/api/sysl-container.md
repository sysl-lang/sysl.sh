module: sysl.container
summary: "Five containers, each with a shape a slice and a `Buf` cannot give you."
---

`Map` and `Set` over one flat probe table, `Deque` for a queue cheap at both ends, `Heap` for a
priority queue, and `List` — an immutable singly linked list that shares its tail. Every one of
them owns its elements and grows, so every one of them needs an allocator; the fixed-capacity
complement is `sysl.container.ring`, which needs none.

**A module rather than five**, because what a program wants from here is a data structure and the
choice between them is the interesting part. Each file's own header says what its structure costs
and when to reach for it instead of its neighbour.

## Functions

### `deque`

```sysl
deque[T]() -> Deque[T]
```

### `deque_with_capacity`

```sysl
deque_with_capacity[T](n: usize, fill: T) -> Deque[T]
```

A deque with room for `n` elements already under it. The fill is written rather than inferred for
the reason it is on `buf_with_capacity`: nothing about `T` says what an unused slot should hold,
and none of these slots is read.

The storage is rounded **up** to a power of two, because the mask every index goes through is only
correct for those lengths.

### `difference`

```sysl
difference[K: Hash + Eq](a: Set[K], b: Set[K]) -> Set[K]
```

The keys in the first set and not the second. Not symmetric, so it walks `a` whatever the sizes.

### `heap`

```sysl
heap[T: Ord]() -> Heap[T]
```

### `heap_of`

```sysl
heap_of[T: Ord](xs: []const T) -> Heap[T]
```

Every element of a slice heaped at once.

**This is linear where pushing them one at a time is not**, and the difference is the reason it is
worth having rather than a convenience: sifting down from the last parent to the root touches each
element once at a depth that halves as it rises, which comes to O(n), while n pushes come to
O(n log n). The elements go in unordered and the heap property is established afterwards.

### `heap_with_capacity`

```sysl
heap_with_capacity[T: Ord](n: usize, fill: T) -> Heap[T]
```

A heap whose storage is already big enough for `n` elements. The fill is written for the reason
`buf_with_capacity`'s is: a generic `T` has no zero, and none of these slots is read.

### `intersection`

```sysl
intersection[K: Hash + Eq](a: Set[K], b: Set[K]) -> Set[K]
```

The keys in both sets. **The smaller set is the one walked**, because every key walked costs a
lookup in the other and the result cannot be bigger than the smaller input -- so walking the
larger would ask more questions to reach the same answer.

### `is_subset`

```sysl
is_subset[K: Hash + Eq](a: Set[K], b: Set[K]) -> bool
```

Whether every key of the first set is in the second. A set cannot be a subset of a smaller one, so
the count settles most calls before a single lookup is made.

### `list`

```sysl
list[T]() -> List[T]
```

The empty list.

### `list_of`

```sysl
list_of[T](xs: []const T) -> List[T]
```

A list of a slice's elements, in the same order.

The slice is walked **backwards**, because a list is built by putting things on the front: walking
forwards would produce the reverse and need a second pass to correct.

### `map`

```sysl
map[K: Hash + Eq, V]() -> Map[K, V]
```

An empty map, which holds **no table at all** until something is put in it.

**An empty map does not allocate**, which matters far more than it looks: a map built inside a
loop, held in a struct that is usually empty, or made and dropped on a branch that turns out not
to be taken costs a `malloc` and the `free` behind it every time, and no caller can see that it is
paying. The first `put` finds the table over its load -- nothing is over nothing -- and rehashes
to `initial_slots` before it places anything, which is the path `put` already took for a table
that had filled up. So there is no separate "grow from empty" case to get wrong.

Reach for `map_with_capacity` where entries are known to be coming: a caller who names a size is
saying so, and gets its table immediately.

**The annotation on `m` is required and is not noise.** `Map`'s parameters would have to come from
the constructor's arguments while the empty table waits to hear what it is a table of, and neither
can go first.

### `map_with_capacity`

```sysl
map_with_capacity[K: Hash + Eq, V](n: usize) -> Map[K, V]
```

A map whose table is already big enough for `n` entries without rehashing, for a caller that knows
roughly how many are coming. The table is sized to twice `n` because the map rehashes at three
quarters full, so a table of exactly `n` slots would grow before the `n`th entry arrived.

### `set`

```sysl
set[K: Hash + Eq]() -> Set[K]
```

### `set_of`

```sysl
set_of[K: Hash + Eq](xs: []const K) -> Set[K]
```

Every key of a slice, with duplicates collapsed. The shape that makes a set worth reaching for in
one line rather than three.

### `set_with_capacity`

```sysl
set_with_capacity[K: Hash + Eq](n: usize) -> Set[K]
```

### `union`

```sysl
union[K: Hash + Eq](a: Set[K], b: Set[K]) -> Set[K]
```

The keys in either set. Sized for the larger of the two, since that is the least it can come to.

## Types

### `Cursor`

```sysl
struct Cursor[K, V]
    cell: []Slot[K, V]
    at: usize
```

A position in a table: which slot to look at next.

It takes **no bounds**, which is the point of writing them on the declarations that need them:
walking a table hashes nothing and compares nothing, so a cursor asks nothing of a key.

### `Deque`

```sysl
struct Deque[T]
    elems: []T
    head: usize
    count: usize
```

A sequence that grows and that is cheap to take from at **either** end.

**The reason this exists beside `Buf` is one line of cost.** A queue written over a growable
sequence takes from the front with `remove(0)`, which shifts every remaining element down one --
so a loop that pushes n things and pops them all is quadratic, and reads as though it were linear.
That is the shape of every breadth-first walk, every work list and every scheduler run queue, and
it is the one place the library was quietly teaching an accident.

**The elements live in a ring**: `head` says where the first one is, `count` says how many follow,
and both ends wrap around the end of the storage rather than moving anything. Taking from the
front advances `head` and touches nothing else; adding to the front steps it backwards into the
space that leaves. Neither end shifts, which is the whole point.

**The storage length is always a power of two**, because it starts at eight and only ever doubles,
so wrapping is a mask rather than a division. That invariant is worth stating because it is what
every index calculation here assumes -- there is no `%` anywhere below, and a growth path that
produced a non-power-of-two length would break all of them at once rather than visibly.

The bounds-checked members panic rather than answering an `Option`, which is the bargain `Buf`
makes for the same reason: an index past the end is a mistake in the program. `pop_front` and
`pop_back` answer an `Option`, because taking from an empty sequence is a question a caller asks
on purpose.

| Member | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `len` | `len(self) -> usize` |  |
| `cap` | `cap(self) -> usize` |  |
| `is_empty` | `is_empty(self) -> bool` |  |
| `at` | `at(self, i: usize) -> T` |  |
| `set` | `set(*self, i: usize, v: T)` |  |
| `first` | `first(self) -> Option[T]` |  |
| `last` | `last(self) -> Option[T]` |  |
| `push_back` | `push_back(*self, v: T)` |  |
| `push_front` | `push_front(*self, v: T)` | The end `Buf` has no answer for at all. |
| `pop_front` | `pop_front(*self) -> Option[T]` |  |
| `pop_back` | `pop_back(*self) -> Option[T]` |  |
| `clear` | `clear(*self)` | The elements dropped and the head put back at the start. |
| `walk` | `walk(self) -> DequeCursor[T]` |  |

### `DequeCursor`

```sysl
struct DequeCursor[T]
    elems: []T
    head: usize
    count: usize
    at: usize
```

A walk from the front to the back. It holds the storage rather than the deque, so pushing onto the
deque while a cursor is live leaves the cursor reading the ring it started on.

### `Heap`

```sysl
struct Heap[T: Ord]
    elems: Buf[T]
```

A priority queue: the smallest element is always the next one out.

**It is a MIN-heap, and that is a decision rather than a coin toss.** The three things a priority
queue is actually reached for -- a scheduler ordered by deadline, a shortest-path search ordered
by distance, an event loop ordered by time -- all want the *smallest* first, and all three would
otherwise have to negate their keys to get it. A max-heap is a min-heap over a reversed
comparison, and reversing `Ord` needs a wrapper type the caller would have to declare, so
whichever way round this goes one set of callers pays. It goes the way the common cases want.

**The shape is a binary heap laid out in a `Buf`**, with no tree and no pointers: the children of
the element at `i` are at `2i + 1` and `2i + 2`, and its parent is at `(i - 1) / 2`. So the whole
structure is arithmetic over a growable sequence the library already has, which is why this module
is short -- `Buf` does the growing and this does the ordering.

The heap property is that no element is smaller than its parent. That is weaker than sorted, which
is exactly why `push` and `pop` are logarithmic rather than linear: only one path from a leaf to
the root is ever touched.

**Walking a heap is deliberately not offered.** The storage order is not the priority order --
only the *first* element is guaranteed to be anything in particular -- so a cursor over it would
hand back elements in an order that looks meaningful and is not. Draining with `pop` is how a heap
is read in order, and it is the only way that answers truthfully.

| Member | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `len` | `len(self) -> usize` |  |
| `is_empty` | `is_empty(self) -> bool` |  |
| `peek` | `peek(self) -> Option[T]` | The smallest element, left where it is. |
| `push` | `push(*self, v: T)` | An element added, then carried up past every parent it is smaller than. |
| `pop` | `pop(*self) -> Option[T]` | The smallest element removed and returned. |
| `clear` | `clear(*self)` |  |

### `List`

```sysl
struct List[T]
    cell: Option[&Cell[T]]
    count: usize
```

A list, which is a first cell or nothing, and the number of cells after it.

**The length is carried rather than counted, and immutability is what makes that free.** A cell's
tail never changes, so a length worked out when the list was built stays true forever -- there is
no operation that could invalidate it. A mutable list would have to walk to answer `len`, or
maintain the count against every mutation; this pays one addition at `prepend` and answers in
constant time for the rest of the list's life.

| Member | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `len` | `len(self) -> usize` |  |
| `is_empty` | `is_empty(self) -> bool` |  |
| `first` | `first(self) -> Option[T]` | The first element, or `None`. |
| `rest` | `rest(self) -> Option[List[T]]` | Everything after the first element, or `None` where there is no first element. |
| `uncons` | `uncons(self) -> Option[(T, List[T])]` | The first element and the rest, in one question. |
| `prepend` | `prepend(self, v: T) -> List[T]` | A new list with `v` on the front, sharing the whole of this one. |
| `reverse` | `reverse(self) -> List[T]` | The same elements in the opposite order, which costs a cell each because nothing of the original can be shared: a reversed list's tails are not tails of the original. |
| `walk` | `walk(self) -> ListCursor[T]` |  |

### `ListCursor`

```sysl
struct ListCursor[T]
    at: Option[&Cell[T]]
```

A position in a list, which is just the cell to look at next -- there is nothing else to remember,
since a cell knows the whole of the rest of the list.

It holds the cell rather than the list, and holding it is what keeps it alive: a cursor part-way
through a list that nothing else refers to still owns the cells it has not reached.

### `Map`

```sysl
struct Map[K: Hash + Eq, V]
    cell: []Slot[K, V]
    count: usize
    dead: usize
```

A mapping from keys to values, with a key found in constant time on average.

`dead` is carried rather than recomputed because it decides when to rehash and is asked for on
every insert; counting tombstones would be a walk of the whole table to answer a question about
one slot.

| Member | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `len` | `len(self) -> usize` |  |
| `is_empty` | `is_empty(self) -> bool` |  |
| `capacity` | `capacity(self) -> usize` | How many slots the table has, which is what the load factor is measured against. |
| `get` | `get(self, k: K) -> Option[V]` |  |
| `get_or` | `get_or(self, k: K, default: V) -> V` | The value a key names, or the one the caller supplies where it names none. |
| `has` | `has(self, k: K) -> bool` |  |
| `put` | `put(*self, k: K, v: V)` | A key given a value: the entry it already had takes the new one, or a fresh entry is placed. |
| `remove` | `remove(*self, k: K) -> bool` | A key taken out, answering whether it was there. |
| `clear` | `clear(*self)` | Every entry dropped and the table let go entirely, so that a map used as scratch across a loop does not keep the largest table any pass through it needed -- and a map that is cleared and never used again costs nothing at all. |
| `walk` | `walk(self) -> Cursor[K, V]` | A cursor over the entries, in no particular order -- the order is the table's, which changes when it rehashes and is not something a program may rely on. |

### `Set`

```sysl
struct Set[K: Hash + Eq]
    entries: Map[K, bool]
```

A set of keys, with membership answered in constant time on average.

**It is a `Map` with nothing in the value column**, and that is a deliberate choice about where the
duplication goes rather than laziness. A bespoke table would save the value slot -- for a
`Set[int]` that is eight bytes of padding per slot against twenty-four -- and would cost a second
copy of the probing, the tombstone rule and the rehash sizing, which is the part of a hash table
that is actually hard to get right. Two copies of that is two places for it to be wrong, and only
one of them would have the tests.

**The representation is behind the API**, which is what makes the choice reversible: `add`, `has`
and `remove` say nothing about how the table is laid out, so a bespoke table can replace this one
later without moving anything a program can name.

The value stored is `true` throughout and is never read. What carries the information is whether
the key is in the map at all.

| Member | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `len` | `len(self) -> usize` |  |
| `is_empty` | `is_empty(self) -> bool` |  |
| `capacity` | `capacity(self) -> usize` |  |
| `has` | `has(self, k: K) -> bool` |  |
| `add` | `add(*self, k: K) -> bool` | A key put in, answering whether it was **new**. |
| `remove` | `remove(*self, k: K) -> bool` | A key taken out, answering whether it was there. |
| `clear` | `clear(*self)` |  |
| `walk` | `walk(self) -> SetCursor[K]` |  |

### `SetCursor`

```sysl
struct SetCursor[K]
    inner: Cursor[K, bool]
```

A position in a set, which is a position in the map underneath it with the unread value dropped
on the way out.

### `Slot`

```sysl
enum Slot[K, V]
    Empty
    Dead
    Live(hash: u64, key: K, value: V)
```

One slot of the table, which is one of three things: never used, used and vacated, or holding an
entry.

**`Empty` and `Dead` are different and the difference is the whole probing scheme.** A probe stops
at `Empty`, because a key that hashed here would have been placed at the first free slot it found
and so cannot be further along. It does **not** stop at `Dead`: something was here when the key it
is looking for was inserted, so the chain it belongs to may continue past it.

`Live` carries the hash beside the key so that a probe can reject a slot on an integer comparison
and `rehash` can re-place an entry without asking the key to mix itself down again.

| Member | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `value` | `value(self) -> Option[V]` | What a slot holds, for a caller that has an index and wants the value at it. |
| `is_live` | `is_live(self) -> bool` |  |

## Implementations

### Index for Deque[T]

```sysl
impl[T] Index[usize, T] for Deque[T]
```

Subscripting reaches the bounds-checked members rather than the storage, so `d[i]` counts from the
**front** of the deque and cannot read a slot the ring is not currently using.

### IndexSet for Deque[T]

```sysl
impl[T] IndexSet[usize, T] for Deque[T]
```

### Iterate for Cursor[K, V]

```sysl
impl[K, V] Iterate for Cursor[K, V]
```

A pair per entry rather than a reference to one, because there is no entry to refer to -- an entry
lives inside the table, and a reference into storage that `rehash` replaces is the one thing this
design exists to make impossible.

### Iterate for DequeCursor[T]

```sysl
impl[T] Iterate for DequeCursor[T]
```

### Iterate for ListCursor[T]

```sysl
impl[T] Iterate for ListCursor[T]
```

### Iterate for SetCursor[K]

```sysl
impl[K] Iterate for SetCursor[K]
```
