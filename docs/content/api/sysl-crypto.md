## Functions

### `hkdf1`

```sysl
hkdf1(salt: []const u8, ikm: []const u8, info: []const u8, out: []u8) -> Result[unit, Fault]
```

HKDF (RFC 5869) in one call: a secret is condensed with the salt and then spread into `out`.

**The secret must already be unguessable** -- a Diffie-Hellman result, a key from a hardware
source -- because nothing here raises the cost of guessing it. A password goes to `pbkdf2_hmac256`
instead.

**`info` is what keeps two keys derived from one secret apart**, and it is a label rather than a
secret: a protocol writes its own name and the key's purpose there, and a different `info` yields
an unrelated key. The salt may be empty, which is the standard's own default -- HMAC pads a short
key with zeroes, so an empty salt *is* the zero key the standard names.

At most 255 digests' worth of key can be asked for, which the standard's one-byte counter fixes.

**Extract on its own is `hmac256(salt, ikm)`** and needs nothing from this module: HKDF-Extract is
HMAC with the salt as the key, which is why only expansion has a name of its own below.

### `hkdf1_expand`

```sysl
hkdf1_expand(prk: []const u8, info: []const u8, out: []u8) -> Result[unit, Fault]
```

HKDF's expansion alone (RFC 5869 §2.3), over a pseudorandom key the caller already has.

**This is the half TLS 1.3 leans on**: `HKDF-Expand-Label` is this function with the label written
into `info` in the shape §7.1 gives, and `Derive-Secret` is one of those per traffic and exporter
secret in the schedule. Signal's chains are the same shape.

The key should be a digest's worth of unguessable bytes -- what `hmac256(salt, ikm)`, which is
HKDF-Extract, answers with. At most 255 digests' worth of key can be asked for.

### `hkdf224`

```sysl
hkdf224(salt: []const u8, ikm: []const u8, info: []const u8, out: []u8) -> Result[unit, Fault]
```

### `hkdf224_expand`

```sysl
hkdf224_expand(prk: []const u8, info: []const u8, out: []u8) -> Result[unit, Fault]
```

### `hkdf256`

```sysl
hkdf256(salt: []const u8, ikm: []const u8, info: []const u8, out: []u8) -> Result[unit, Fault]
```

### `hkdf256_expand`

```sysl
hkdf256_expand(prk: []const u8, info: []const u8, out: []u8) -> Result[unit, Fault]
```

### `hkdf384`

```sysl
hkdf384(salt: []const u8, ikm: []const u8, info: []const u8, out: []u8) -> Result[unit, Fault]
```

### `hkdf384_expand`

```sysl
hkdf384_expand(prk: []const u8, info: []const u8, out: []u8) -> Result[unit, Fault]
```

### `hkdf512`

```sysl
hkdf512(salt: []const u8, ikm: []const u8, info: []const u8, out: []u8) -> Result[unit, Fault]
```

### `hkdf512_expand`

```sysl
hkdf512_expand(prk: []const u8, info: []const u8, out: []u8) -> Result[unit, Fault]
```

### `hmac1`

```sysl
hmac1(key: []const u8, msg: []const u8) -> [20]u8
```

HMAC-SHA-1, answering a twenty-byte tag. A key longer than a block is replaced by its own
digest; a shorter one is padded with zeroes.

**This is a weaker warning than `sha1` carries, and deliberately so.** HMAC's security does not
rest on the hash being collision resistant, so HMAC-SHA-1 is not broken the way SHA-1 is -- which
is why RFC 6238 still specifies it as TOTP's default and why a great deal of deployed request
signing still uses it. It is here to talk to those. A protocol being written now wants `hmac256`.

### `hmac224`

```sysl
hmac224(key: []const u8, msg: []const u8) -> [28]u8
```

### `hmac256`

```sysl
hmac256(key: []const u8, msg: []const u8) -> [32]u8
```

### `hmac384`

```sysl
hmac384(key: []const u8, msg: []const u8) -> [48]u8
```

### `hmac512`

```sysl
hmac512(key: []const u8, msg: []const u8) -> [64]u8
```

### `hmacmd5`

```sysl
hmacmd5(key: []const u8, msg: []const u8) -> [16]u8
```

HMAC-MD5, answering a sixteen-byte tag. A key longer than a block is replaced by its own digest;
a shorter one is padded with zeroes.

**The same weaker warning `hmac1` carries applies here, and for the same reason.** HMAC's security
does not rest on the hash being collision resistant, so HMAC-MD5 is not broken the way `md5` is --
RFC 6151 says as much, while advising against it for anything new. It is here for what already
asks: HTTP Digest with `qop`, CRAM-MD5, and RADIUS, none of which lets a client choose. A protocol
being written now wants `hmac256`.

### `md5`

```sysl
md5(data: []const u8) -> [16]u8
```

The digest of one slice of bytes, sixteen bytes long.

**MD5 is broken, and has been since 2004.** A collision is buildable, and a chosen-prefix
collision has been since 2007 -- a pair of colliding X.509 certificates was built to show it. So
this digest says nothing about a document nobody could have substituted: it must not carry a
signature, a certificate, a content address or a deduplication key. **`sha256` is what all of
those want.**

It is in this module for the protocols that name it and give a client no say. PostgreSQL's `md5`
authentication answers a salt with `md5(md5(password + user) + salt)`; HTTP Digest, a
`Content-MD5` header and an S3 `ETag` are the same shape. Where an attacker gains nothing from a
second document with the same digest, MD5 is adequate; everywhere else it is not, and there is no
third case.

### `new_md5`

```sysl
new_md5() -> Md5
```

A hasher ready for its first `update`.

**MD5 is broken.** Reach for `new_sha256` unless a wire protocol names this one; see `md5`.

### `new_sha1`

```sysl
new_sha1() -> Sha1
```

A hasher ready for its first `update`.

**SHA-1 is broken.** Reach for `new_sha256` unless a wire protocol names this one; see `sha1`.

### `new_sha224`

```sysl
new_sha224() -> Sha224
```

### `new_sha256`

```sysl
new_sha256() -> Sha256
```

### `new_sha384`

```sysl
new_sha384() -> Sha384
```

### `new_sha512`

```sysl
new_sha512() -> Sha512
```

### `pbkdf2_hmac1`

```sysl
pbkdf2_hmac1(password: []const u8, salt: []const u8, iterations: u32, out: []u8) -> Result[unit, Fault]
```

PBKDF2 over HMAC-SHA-1, writing as much key as `out` has room for.

**It is the one an existing protocol names**: WPA2 derives its pairwise master key this way, and
so does SCRAM-SHA-1 and a great deal of deployed password storage. A scheme being written now
wants `pbkdf2_hmac256`, and something built for the purpose -- Argon2, scrypt -- before either.

The iteration count is the caller's because the protocol says it: SCRAM carries the server's count
on the wire, and a client that used its own would derive a different key and be told its password
was wrong. It must be at least one.

### `pbkdf2_hmac224`

```sysl
pbkdf2_hmac224(password: []const u8, salt: []const u8, iterations: u32, out: []u8) -> Result[unit, Fault]
```

PBKDF2 over HMAC-SHA-2, writing as much key as `out` has room for.

**`pbkdf2_hmac256` is the one to reach for**, being what SCRAM-SHA-256 names -- so PostgreSQL,
MongoDB, Kafka and XMPP -- and what WebCrypto's `deriveBits` is usually asked for.

The iteration count is the caller's, is named by the protocol, and must be at least one. What it
buys is the cost of *guessing*, and nothing else: a password that could be guessed in a thousand
tries still can be, a hundred thousand times more slowly.

### `pbkdf2_hmac256`

```sysl
pbkdf2_hmac256(password: []const u8, salt: []const u8, iterations: u32, out: []u8) -> Result[unit, Fault]
```

### `pbkdf2_hmac384`

```sysl
pbkdf2_hmac384(password: []const u8, salt: []const u8, iterations: u32, out: []u8) -> Result[unit, Fault]
```

### `pbkdf2_hmac512`

```sysl
pbkdf2_hmac512(password: []const u8, salt: []const u8, iterations: u32, out: []u8) -> Result[unit, Fault]
```

### `sha1`

```sysl
sha1(data: []const u8) -> [20]u8
```

The digest of one slice of bytes, which is the whole of what most callers want.

**SHA-1 is broken, and has been publicly broken since 2017.** A collision is buildable, and since
2019 a chosen-prefix collision is, so this digest says nothing about a document nobody could have
substituted: it must not carry a signature, a certificate, a content address or a deduplication
key. **`sha256` is what all of those want.**

It is in this module for **RFC 6455's opening handshake**, which answers a client's key with
`base64(sha1(key + "258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11"))` and names both the algorithm and the
constant in the standard, so there is no substitute. That use makes no security claim at all --
the handshake shows the far end read the request and authenticates nobody -- which is why an
algorithm this broken still serves it. Where a second preimage would buy an attacker nothing,
SHA-1 is adequate; everywhere else it is not, and there is no third case.

### `sha224`

```sysl
sha224(data: []const u8) -> [28]u8
```

### `sha256`

```sysl
sha256(data: []const u8) -> [32]u8
```

### `sha384`

sha384(data: []const u8) -> [48]u8
```

### `sha512`

```sysl
sha512(data: []const u8) -> [64]u8
```

### `verify`

```sysl
verify(a: []const u8, b: []const u8) -> bool
```
