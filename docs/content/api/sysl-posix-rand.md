summary: "A seed taken from the host, for a program that wants a different sequence on every run."
requires: "no alloc, requires { posix }"
---

**This is a module of its own so that `sysl.rand` is not.** A directory is a module, so a second
file under `rand/` would *be* `sysl.rand` and importing the generator would drag an operating
system in behind it -- and the generator is deliberately usable on a target that has none. A
freestanding program imports `sysl.rand` and never names this.

**It lives under `sysl.posix` rather than under `sysl.rand` because `getentropy(2)` is what it
is**, and that is the rule the whole namespace follows: a module there is one a freestanding
target does not get. `sysl.posix.tty` sits beside `sysl.term` for the same reason.

**`seed_from_os` is entropy for SEEDING, and it is not a cryptographic generator.** What it feeds
is PCG32, whose whole output is computable by anyone who sees a few of its values. Seeding a
predictable generator unpredictably does not make it unpredictable, and `sysl.rand` should not be
mistaken for a source of key material.

**`entropy_from_os` IS that source, and the distinction is the point of having both.** The kernel's
pool is exactly what a salt, a nonce, an IV, a session id or a token wants; what must not be
mistaken for one is the generator the seed is fed to. Everything `sysl.crypto` and every binding
over monocypher or openssl says about randomness is *"the caller brings it"*, and before this
there was nothing in sysl for the caller to bring it from -- so a program wanting sixteen fresh
bytes opened `/dev/urandom` by hand, which works, and is a descriptor, an open, a read and a close
for something the kernel answers in one call.

## Functions

### `entropy_from_os`

```sysl
entropy_from_os(into: []u8) -> bool
```

`into` filled from the kernel's entropy pool, or `false` where the host would not supply it.

**This is the source key material comes from**, unlike `seed_from_os` above it, which feeds a
generator that is not one. A salt, a nonce, an IV, a session id and a token all want these bytes
and want nothing computed from them.

**A slice longer than 256 bytes is filled by looping**, because that is `getentropy(2)`'s limit
per call and not a limit on what a caller may ask for. Refusing a longer slice was the other road
and is worse: every real caller wants 16 or 32, so the cap would be a rule nobody meets and
everybody has to read about, and the loop is three lines.

**An empty slice is filled successfully**, which is what a loop over no bytes means. It is worth
saying because the alternative -- asking the kernel for zero bytes -- is a call some libcs refuse.

Answers a `bool` rather than trapping, for `seed_from_os`'s reason turned the other way round: a
caller who cannot get entropy has no reasonable fallback for key material and must **stop**, and a
value it has to look at is what makes that a decision rather than an omission.

### `seed_from_os`

```sysl
seed_from_os() -> Option[u64]
```

Eight bytes of host entropy as a seed, or `None` where the host would not supply them.

**Answers an `Option` rather than trapping.** A program that cannot get entropy usually has a
reasonable fallback -- a fixed seed, and a line in its log saying so -- and a library that aborted
would take that choice away.
