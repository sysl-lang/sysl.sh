summary: "The platform seam: everything the library asks of what it is hosted on, and nothing else."
requires: "no alloc"

The C declarations behind printing, reading, searching and the mathematics library live here and
are declared nowhere else, so **what a freestanding target has to replace is this module and only
this module**. That is the whole reason it exists as a module rather than as an extern beside each
caller.

It is a leaf: it imports nothing from the rest of the library, and it gives the allocator up —
declaring a C function reaches no heap, whatever that function goes on to do.
