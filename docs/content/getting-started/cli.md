title: The command line
summary: Six subcommands, the flags they share, and what each one leaves as an exit status.
weight: 30
---

Every subcommand takes a **path**, and a path is either a project root or a single file. That is not
two modes bolted together — a module is a directory and its name is that directory's path relative
to the root, so naming a directory compiles the whole tree under it, one module per directory, and
naming a file compiles that file alone. The [modules reference](/reference/modules/) has the rule
the path is standing on.

## The subcommands

| | what it does |
|---|---|
| `sysl run <path>` | compile and execute |
| `sysl build <path> -o <exe>` | compile to a native executable |
| `sysl build-lib <path> -o <artifact>` | compile a library to a linkable artifact |
| `sysl test <path>` | run the `#test` functions |
| `sysl emit-llvm <path>` | print the generated LLVM IR |
| `sysl targets` | list the machines sysl can build for |

A subcommand is required; sysl with none exits 2 and prints its usage.

### `run`

```bash
sysl run hello.sysl
```

Four things in a row: the source is parsed and checked, textual LLVM IR is emitted, `clang`
assembles and links it, and the binary runs. The executable goes to a temporary file and is removed
afterwards — `run` leaves nothing behind.

**Everything after a bare `--` belongs to the program**, not to sysl:

```bash
sysl run report.sysl -- --verbose report.txt
```

The split is made *before* sysl's own options are parsed, which is the point: `--verbose` really is
one of sysl's own options, so without the `--` sysl would have taken it — after it, it belongs to the
program, and neither side has to know what the other's flags are called. What arrives at
[`main(args: []string)`](/library/args/) is the executable's own path followed by those two words,
so `args.len` is 3 — `args[0]` is the program, exactly as C's `argv[0]` is.

**`run` exits with the status the program exited with.** It is running your program, so its status
is your program's — a compilation that failed is what exits 1 on sysl's own behalf.

### `build`

```bash
sysl build hello.sysl -o hello
```

The same compilation, stopping at the executable instead of running it. `wrote hello` goes to
stderr so that stdout stays whatever the build was for.

**`-o` is optional, and where it writes depends on what you named.** Given a **file**, the name is
that file's, with its extension dropped, in the current directory: `src/tools/fmt.sysl` becomes
`fmt` beside you.

Given a **directory**, the executable goes *inside* it, named after it. `sysl build .`,
`sysl build fmt` and `sysl build ../fmt` are three ways of naming one project, and all three write
`fmt/fmt` — so the answer does not depend on where you were standing when you asked. `build-lib`
follows the same rule, writing `fmt/fmt.syslib` into the root it was built from.

**A project whose `package.hocon` names dependencies gets them fetched here**, if this machine has
not got them already — see [packages](/reference/packages/). `run` and `test` do the same; there is
no separate step to remember, and a project with no dependencies does none of it.

### `build-lib`

```bash
sysl build-lib mylib -o mylib.syslib
sysl run prog.sysl --lib mylib.syslib
```

A library compiled once into the two halves a program links against. See
[modules](/reference/modules/) for what an artifact holds and why the generic half of it travels as
trees rather than as object code.

Building one needs an `llvm-ar` as well as a `clang`, because a `.syslib` **is** an `ar` archive —
[installation](/getting-started/installation/) has the note about which `ar` and why the platform
one will not do.

### `test`

```bash
sysl test <path>
sysl test <path> --filter <text>
sysl test <path> --fail-fast
```

The tree is compiled once, into a binary that runs one named test per process, and the runner starts
it once per test. [Attributes](/reference/attributes/) has `#test` itself — what a test may be, what
every other build does with one, and why the process per test is the mechanism rather than a cost.

The report groups by the file each test was written in, keeps source order inside a file, and shows
a test's output **only** where it failed:

```
running 4 tests

clamp.sysl
  ok    clamps below the low bound   6ms
  ok    clamps above the high bound  5ms
  FAIL  leaves a value in range      5ms
        did not return — exit status 1
        at clamp.sysl:31
        > panic: clamp(4, 1, 3) should be 3
  ok    is idempotent                5ms

3 passed, 1 failed — 21ms
```

A failure's own line is one of three sentences and never more: **`did not return — exit status n`**,
which is what a failed `assert` looks like since `assert` prints and exits; **`returned, and was
expected to trap`**; and **`trapped, but printed nothing holding "…"`**, for a
`#test(should_trap: "…")` whose run trapped without saying it. Everything the run printed follows
underneath, prefixed `>`.

`--filter` keeps the tests whose name **or module** holds the text, and the header says how many of
how many are running. `--fail-fast` stops the loop rather than the report: what ran is still
reported and what never ran is simply absent, because "skipped" would be a third verdict for
something that is not a verdict.

**Exit status is 0 if and only if every test that ran passed.** A tree with no tests at all, and a
filter that matched none of the tests there are, both exit 0 — neither is a failure, and each says
which of the two happened rather than leaving one empty report to mean both.

### `emit-llvm`

```bash
sysl emit-llvm hello.sysl
```

The IR to stdout, the same text `run` and `build` hand to clang. Nothing is assembled and no
toolchain is needed for it.

### `targets`

The registry, one line per machine — the name to write after `--target`, the LLVM triple it stands
for, and, for a target sysl knows and cannot build for, why not:

```
aarch64-macos         arm64-apple-macosx
x86_64-macos          x86_64-apple-macosx
aarch64-linux         aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
x86_64-linux          x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
riscv64-linux         riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu
x86_64-windows        x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
aarch64-freestanding  aarch64-none-elf
x86_64-freestanding   x86_64-unknown-none-elf
riscv64-freestanding  riscv64-unknown-elf
x86-linux             i386-unknown-linux-gnu  (32-bit — not yet supported)
```

The line for the machine you are on is marked `(this machine)`, and a last line repeats what that
machine's own runtime called itself. That last line is there for the case the rest of the list
cannot help with: on a machine sysl has no entry for, it is the only place to read what the machine
actually said.

`x86-linux` is listed *because* it cannot be built for. The limit is the compiler's rather than the
machine's — the emitted code assumes a 64-bit address in places nothing has been asked to
parameterize yet — and a reader who names it is better told that than told the name is unknown.

## Flags every subcommand takes

| | |
|---|---|
| `--target <name>` | the machine to build for; defaults to this one |
| `--lib <path>` | a library to compile against; may be given more than once |
| `--std-lib <path>` | a prebuilt standard module |
| `--no-std-lib` | compile the standard module from source rather than linking a prebuilt one |
| `--ar <path>` | the `llvm-ar` to build a library with |
| `-O <level>` | the optimization level handed to clang |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | report what the build decided — the standard module, the files read, the command lines |
| `--explain-escapes` | report every local array promoted to the heap |

The standard-module flags and `-O` are covered in
[installation](/getting-started/installation/), including why the default is `-O1` and not off.

### `--lib` takes either a source tree or an artifact

Which one a path names is read off the name: a `.syslib` is decoded, anything else is walked as
source. That is deliberate — how a library was shipped is the shipper's business, and a program
depending on one should not have to write down which it got. `build-lib` is what turns the first
into the second, and the only difference downstream is what the compilation *cost*: an artifact is a
linear decode where source is a parse.

### `--target`, and the one thing `run` will not do

Given no `--target`, a build is for the machine it is running on. If that is a machine sysl has no
entry for, it says so and stops rather than guessing, because a wrong guess produces a module that
looks right and is not.

`run` executes what it builds, and only this machine can do that, so a cross target is refused
before the build rather than after it:

```
sysl: error: 'run' executes what it builds, and 'x86_64-linux' is not this machine — use 'sysl build --target x86_64-linux'
```

A name the registry does not have is answered with the names it does:

```
sysl: error: unknown target 'arm-linux' — sysl knows aarch64-macos, x86_64-macos, aarch64-linux, x86_64-linux, riscv64-linux, x86_64-windows, aarch64-freestanding, x86_64-freestanding, riscv64-freestanding, x86-linux
```

### `-v`, `--verbose`

What the build decided, on stderr — which is where `wrote <exe>` goes, so stdout stays whatever the
build was for:

```
sysl: 1 source file(s) under hello
sysl:   read hello/hello.sysl
sysl: standard module linked from ~/Library/Caches/sysl/0.0.19-…/std.syslib
sysl: link: clang --target=arm64-apple-macosx -Wno-override-module -O1 …
```

Three things, and they are the three that have actually been the answer to a question: **which
standard module** the compilation got and whether it was linked or compiled from source, the **files
it read**, and the **command lines** handed to clang together with the `--lib`, `--link-path` and
`--include-path` searches behind them. There are no phase timings: a build that is slow is diagnosed
by asking what it *did*.

### `--explain-escapes`

On stderr, one line per local array the compiler moved to the heap, and the view that forced the
move:

```
$ sysl build --explain-escapes tty.sysl
tty.sysl:31:12: 'buf' is promoted to the heap, because this view of it is returned
```

The position is the **view**, not the declaration, because that is the half a reader cannot work out
for themselves. Where nothing was promoted it says so, in as many words, rather than printing
nothing and leaving you to wonder whether the flag took. [Memory](/reference/memory/) has what
promotion is and when it happens instead.

### `-O2` is written the way clang writes it

A short option normally takes its value as the next argument, and clang's optimization flag has been
written joined since cc. So `-O2` is rewritten into `-O 2` before the options are parsed — only that
letter, and only where something follows it, so a bare `-O` still takes the next argument and
`--optimize` is untouched. Nothing in that rewrite can reach the program's own arguments, which were
already split off at the `--`.

## Two combinations that are refused

Neither is resolved by precedence, because whichever precedence were chosen would silently discard
half of what was asked for:

```
sysl: error: --core-lib compiles against the standard module, and 'build-lib --core' is what builds it
sysl: error: --no-core-lib and --core-lib ask for different standard modules
```

The first is `build-lib --core --core-lib x`, which cannot mean anything: the declarations being
compiled are the ones the artifact holds. The second is the pair of near-identical spellings that a
typo produces.

## Exit statuses

| | |
|---|---|
| **0** | it worked — and for `test`, every test that ran passed |
| **1** | a compiler diagnostic, a driver error, or a failing test |
| **2** | the command line did not parse |
| *the program's* | `run` only, once the program has started |

A compiler diagnostic is printed exactly as the compiler wrote it, with its location and a caret
under the offending column. A driver error — something that went wrong *around* the compilation
rather than inside it — is prefixed `sysl: error:`, which is why every message quoted on this page
carries it and none of the ones on the language pages do.

Next: the [tour](/tour/), which uses `run` throughout.
